Comprehensive Daily Task Tracking: Users frequently search for checklists or trackers (e.g. “75 Hard challenge checklist” is a common query). An app should provide an easy-to-use daily checklist of all 75 Hard tasks (workouts, water intake, reading, etc.) that users can tick off. The official 75 HARD app already allows tracking of daily tasks with one click​

, so any new app must match this basic functionality.
Reminders to Prevent Failure: Forgetting a task is a big fear (since the challenge restarts if you slip up). Queries like “75 Hard app” show interest in a solution to stay on track, and the official app’s popularity is partly due to its reminder feature​

Summary of Overall Progress: Some users search for ways to get insights into their 75 Hard journey beyond daily tracking. For example, one Reddit user asked if any app can summarize your efforts at the end – e.g. total pages read, total workout minutes, weight lost​

. This suggests a valuable feature: the app could include progress statistics or a summary report once the 75 days are completed (or as the user progresses), giving a sense of accomplishment (e.g. “You read 750 pages and drank 75 gallons of water in 75 days!”).
Community & Accountability Features: Related searches indicate people often look for support or compare apps. Phrases like “best 75 Hard tracker app”​

show that users are discussing which app to use and how to stay accountable together. Consider adding a community aspect: for example, the ability to add friends or join groups to share progress, or an accountability buddy system.

. A smart opportunity is to allow customizable rules or modes in your app. By supporting 75 Hard as well as a 75 Soft (or user-defined) challenge, you can attract a broader audience. For instance, let users modify the number of days or tasks – those not ready for the full 75 Hard might still download your app for a scaled-down challenge.
User Experience and Reliability: Many are searching for the “best” app alternative, which implies some dissatisfaction with existing options. Reviews on Reddit mention the official app’s limited functionality and occasional bugs​

Incorporating some educational content or resources in the app (such as a tips section, or linking to FAQs about the rules) can improve user satisfaction and engagement.
